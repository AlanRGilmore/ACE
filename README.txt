This repository contains Atlas Correlation Explorer (ACE),
a workbench program designed to allow exploration of TCGA data.

ACE was developed at Queen's University, Belfast, within the
Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology.

The source code is provided in full as a Visual Studio project
in the "TCGA Genetic Workbench" folder.  It was developed in C#
and runs on Windows 7 and later. It will also run on OS/X and
Linux environments within Windows virtual machines.

The Release provides downloadable executables and data for ACE.
It also provides a User Guide, which includes installation
instructions, and a White Paper which gives an overview of the
algorithms used in the ACE engine.
